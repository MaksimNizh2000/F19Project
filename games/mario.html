			Use amazing new abilities—like the power to capture and control objects, animals,
			and enemies—to collect Power Moons so you can power up the Odyssey airship and save
			Princess Peach from Bowser's wedding plans!
		</p>
		<p>
			Thanks to heroic, hat-shaped Cappy, Mario's got new moves that'll make you rethink his
			traditional run-and-jump gameplay—like cap jump, cap throw, and capture. Use captured
			cohorts such as enemies, objects, and animals to progress through the game and uncover
			loads of hidden collectibles. And if you feel like playing with a friend, just pass them
			a Joy-Con™ controller! Player 1 controls Mario while Player 2 controls Cappy. This sandbox-style
			3D Mario adventure—the first since 1996's beloved Super Mario 64™ and 2002's Nintendo GameCube™
			classic Super Mario Sunshine™—is packed with secrets and surprises, plus exciting new
			kingdoms to explore.
